# Compile the code
In the terminal, access the directory of the operation type you wish to run:
```
cd <desired_directory>
```

Then, compile the algorithm file with the main function:
```
g++ -o <executable_name> <algorithm_call_file>.c ./src/<linalg>.c
```

Lastly, run the executable file:
```
./<executable_name>
```
